    <h2>Here we will teach you how to master the mac in 2 simple steps!</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 ounces (170g) elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>6 ounces (180ml) evaporated milk</li>
        <li>6 ounces (170g) grated mild or medium cheddar cheese, or any good
             melting cheese, such as Fontina, Gruy√®re, or Jack</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Place macaroni in a medium saucepan or skillet and add just enough
         cold water to cover. Add a pinch of salt and bring to a boil over
          high heat, stirring frequently. Continue to cook, stirring, until
           water has been almost completely absorbed and macaroni is just shy
            of al dente, about 6 minutes.</li>
    <li>Immediately add evaporated milk and bring to a boil.
         Add cheese. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring continuously,
          until cheese is melted and liquid has reduced to a creamy sauce,
           about 2 minutes longer. Season to taste with more salt and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
