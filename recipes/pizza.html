<h2>Here you will learn how to make a cheese pizza like momma</h2>
<p>Here you will see all the sauces, bread, and cheese you will ever need</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 ball Artisan Pizza Dough</li>
    <li>All-purpose flour, for dusting</li>
    <li>Semolina flour, for dusting</li>
    <li>¼ cup Basic Pizza Sauce (recipe follows)</li>
    <li>3 ounces shredded low-moisture mozzarella</li>
    <li>Fresh basil or oregano leaves, for garnishing</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Let chilled covered dough stand at room temperature until dough is
         cool (not cold) and a fingerprint remains when dough is pressed,
          1 to 2 hours. Transfer 1 dough ball to a heavily floured surface.
           Using floured fingertips,
         firmly press all over dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border.</li>
    <li>If cooking in your home oven, preheat to 500°F
         with a baking steel or large round cast-iron
          pizza pan (such as Lodge 15-inch) on middle
          rack. Let pan preheat in oven for about 30 minutes.
           If using an outdoor pizza oven, preheat pizza oven and
            pizza stone according to manufacturer's instructions on
             high 20 minutes. (Note: Cooking with wood takes more experience
              to control the heat, so we've only included instructions for gas 
              oven cooking here.)</li>
    <li>Form a C-shape with the outer edge of your hand,
         and press firmly inside dough border to define a
          1/2-inch wide ring around edge of dough. Lift dough
           onto the knuckles of both hands, and gently stretch,
            rotating dough after each stretch to maintain its round shape.
             Continue gently stretching dough, allowing gravity to help it expand,
              until a 10-inch circle of even thickness forms, with a slightly thicker
               outer ring. Lay dough round on a semolina-dusted pizza peel, reshaping
                as needed to form a circle. Spread dough round with Basic Pizza Sauce.
                 Top with shredded mozzarella.</li>
    <li>
        Gently shake pizza peel with prepared pie to loosen.
         If pizza feels stuck in any areas, carefully lift pizza edge with a bench scraper
         , and dust peel with a 1:1 mixture of semolina and bread flour.
          Unload pizza onto preheated pan in home oven, or onto stone in outdoor
           pizza oven using quick, decisive movements: Set the peel edge on the pan 
           at about a 20-degree angle, and quickly pull back peel to slide half of the
            pizza onto the pan. Gently shake the peel side to side while pulling it back
             to slide the rest of the pizza onto the pan, allowing it to stretch slightly.
</li>
    <li>If baking in a home oven, bake at 500°F until edges of crust
         have puffed slightly, about 3 minutes. Rotate pan 90 degrees,
          and increase oven temperature to broil. Broil until pizza is
           cooked through and crust is browned, 3 to 6 minutes. If baking
            in an outdoor pizza oven, cook pizza, using peel to rotate pizza 
            90 degrees every 20 to 30 seconds, until cooked through and crust
             is risen and charred in spots, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
    <li>Using peel, transfer pizza to a cutting board. Garnish with
         fresh basil or oregano, if desired, and cut into wedges.</li>
